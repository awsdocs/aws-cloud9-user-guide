# Working with the AWS CDK in the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment \(IDE\)<a name="cdk-explorer"></a>

The **AWS CDK service** enables you to work with [AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) applications, or *apps*\. You can find detailed information about the AWS CDK in the [AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\) Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/)\.

AWS CDK apps are composed of building blocks known as *[constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html)*\. These building blocks include definitions for your AWS CloudFormation stacks and the AWS resources within them\. Using the **AWS CDK Explorer**, you can see the [stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/stacks.html) and [resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/resources.html) that are defined in AWS CDK *tree view*\. You can access this view in the Developer Tools pane within the AWS Cloud9 editor\.

This section provides information about how to access and use **AWS CDK ** in the AWS Cloud9 editor\.
