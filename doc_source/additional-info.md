## Pricing<a name="pricing"></a>

There is no additional charge for AWS Cloud9\. If you use an Amazon EC2 instance for your AWS Cloud9 development environment, you pay only for the compute and storage resources \(for example, an Amazon EC2 instance, an Amazon EBS volume\) that are used to run and store your code\. You can also connect your environment to an existing Linux server \(for example, an on\-premises server\) through SSH for no additional charge\.

You only pay for what you use, as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments\. You are charged the normal AWS rates for any AWS resources \(for example, AWS Lambda functions\) that you create or use within your environment\.

New AWS customers who are eligible for the AWS Free Tier can use AWS Cloud9 for free\. If your environment makes use of resources beyond the AWS Free Tier, you are charged the normal AWS rates for those resources\.
