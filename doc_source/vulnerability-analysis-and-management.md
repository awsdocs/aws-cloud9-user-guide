# Configuration and vulnerability analysis in AWS Cloud9<a name="vulnerability-analysis-and-management"></a>

AWS Cloud9 development environments run on top of cloud\-compute resources\. The cloud\-compute resource can be an Amazon EC2 instance \(for an *EC2 environment*\) or your own cloud\-compute resource \(for an *SSH environment*\)\. These possibilities are described in [What is AWS Cloud9?](welcome.md) in the **Environments and Computing Resources** section\.

Regardless of the underlying cloud\-compute resource, it is the responsibility of the AWS Cloud9 user or their AWS Cloud9 administrator to keep the cloud\-compute resource patched and up to date\. If an EC2 environment is chosen when creating the development environment, the initial creation of that environment will have the latest updates\. But even that environment will need to be checked from time to time, depending on the requirements of your organization\.
