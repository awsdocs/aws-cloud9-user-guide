# Getting started: basic tutorials for AWS Cloud9<a name="tutorials-basic"></a>

Are you new to AWS Cloud9? If you haven't done so already, take a look at the general information about AWS Cloud9 in [What Is AWS Cloud9](welcome.md)\.

In the following tutorials, you create an environment in AWS Cloud9 and then use that environment to create a simple application\. Both tutorials have the same input and results, but one uses the AWS Cloud9 console and the other uses the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)\. You can choose to perform either or both\.

When you are finished with these tutorials, you can learn more about the AWS Cloud9 IDE in [Tour the AWS Cloud9 IDE](tour-ide.md)\.
