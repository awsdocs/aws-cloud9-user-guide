# Resuming a Dev Environment<a name="ide-toolkits-resume-cloud9"></a>

Everything in the `$HOME` directory of a Dev Environment is stored persistently\. You can stop working in a Dev Environment if you need to, and resume working in your Dev Environment at a later time\. If a Dev Environment is left idle for the amount of time that was selected in the **Timeout** fields when the Dev Environment was created, it will automatically stop\. 

You can only resume a Dev Environment from CodeCatalyst\. For more information on resuming a Dev Environment, see [ Resuming a Dev Environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/devenvironment-resume.html) in the *Amazon CodeCatalyst guide*\.

**Note**  
Resuming a Dev Environment may take a few minutes\.
