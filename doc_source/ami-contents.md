# Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) contents for an AWS Cloud9 EC2 Development Environment<a name="ami-contents"></a>

Use the following information to get details about Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) that AWS Cloud9 uses for an EC2 environment\.

**Important**  
If your environment's Amazon EC2 instance is based on an Amazon Linux 2 AMI or an Amazon Linux AMI template, security updates are installed on the instance immediately after it's launched\. And security patches are then automatically applied to the instance every hour\. These updates are applied by a background process and don't affect your use of the instance\.  
For an Ubuntu EC2 environment, security updates are also installed on the instance immediately after it's launched\. Then the `unattended-upgrades` package automatically installs available updates daily\.

## Amazon Linux 2/Amazon Linux<a name="ami-contents-amazon-linux"></a>

**Important**  
We recommend that you choose the **Amazon Linux 2** option when [creating an Amazon EC2 environment using the console](create-environment-main.md#create-environment-console)\. As well as providing a secure, stable, and high\-performance runtime environment, Amazon Linux 2 AMI includes long\-term support through 2023\.  
The standard support for the previous version of Amazon Linux AMI was discontinued on December 31,2020\. Now this previous version only receives maintenance support\. For more information, see the [Amazon Linux 2 page](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/)\.  
Unless otherwise specified, references to Amazon Linux in this topic refer to both Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2 instances\.

To display the version of an Amazon Linux instance, run the following command from the AWS Cloud9 IDE for the connected environment or from an SSH utility such as the ssh command or PuTTY\.

```
cat /etc/system-release
```

To display a list of packages that are installed on an Amazon Linux instance, run one or more of the following commands\.

To display all installed packages as a single list:

```
sudo yum list installed
```

To display a list of installed packages with package names containing the specified text:

```
sudo yum list installed | grep YOUR_SEARCH_TERM
```

In the preceding command, replace `YOUR_SEARCH_TERM` with some portion of the package name\. For example, to display a list of all installed packages with names containing `sql`:

```
sudo yum list installed | grep sql
```

To display a list of all installed packages, displayed one page at a time:

```
sudo yum list installed | less
```

To scroll through the displayed pages:

+ To move down a page, press **Ctrl\-F**\.
+ To move up a page, press **Ctrl\-B**\.
+ To quit, press **q**\.

**Note**  
With Amazon Linux 2, you can use the Extras Library to install application and software updates on your instances\. These software updates are known as topics\. For more information, see [Extras library \(Amazon Linux 2\)](Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instancesamazon-linux-ami-basics.html#extras-library) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
