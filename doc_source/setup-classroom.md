## Step 1: Create an AWS account and apply for AWS Educate<a name="setup-classroom-create-account"></a>

In this step, you create an AWS account\. Then you apply for AWS Educate\. During the application process, you provide AWS Educate with your AWS account ID\.

If you already have an AWS account, skip ahead to step 5 of this procedure to apply for AWS Educate\. If you're not sure whether your department or institution already has an existing AWS account for you, or whether you should create a new one on your own, check with your department's or institution's AWS account administrator\.

If you are already a member of AWS Educate, skip ahead to [Step 2: Set up your virtual classroom for AWS Cloud9](#setup-classroom-virtual)\.

1. Go to [https://aws\.amazon\.com](https://aws.amazon.com)\.

1. Choose **Sign In to the Console**\.

1. Choose **Create a new AWS account**\.

1. Complete the process by following the on\-screen directions\. This includes giving AWS your email address and credit card information\. You must also use your phone to enter a code that AWS gives you\.

   After you finish creating the account, AWS sends you a confirmation email\. Do not go past this step in this procedure until you get this confirmation\.

1. Go to the Apply for AWS Educate website, at [https://aws\.amazon\.com/education/awseducate/apply/](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/)\.

1. Choose **Apply for AWS Educate for Educators**\.

1. On the **Tell us about yourself** page, follow the on\-screen instructions\. This includes giving AWS Educate information such as the educational institution that you work for and your email address there\. Leave **Promo Code** blank\.

1. Complete the security challenge, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Choose one of the following** page, select **Click here to enter an AWS Account ID**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. In the box next to **Click here to enter an AWS Account ID**, enter your AWS account ID, and then choose **Next**\. \(To get your AWS account ID, see [Finding Your AWS Account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html#FindingYourAccountIdentifiers) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.\)

1. AWS will send you an email with the title **Email Verification \- AWS Educate Application**\. Choose the link in that email to confirm your email address, review the AWS Educate program terms and conditions, and complete the application process\.

1. After you complete the application process, AWS will send you an email with the title **Thank You for Applying for AWS Educate**\. This email includes details such as how to check the status of your application and how to contact AWS Educate support with any questions\.

   After AWS Educate approves your application, AWS will send you an email with the title **AWS Educate Application Approved**\. Note that the approval process might take a few days\. Do not go past this step in this procedure until you get this approval\.

   After you get the approval email, follow the instructions in the email to set your AWS Educate Educator Collaboration Portal \(ECP\) password, and then sign in to your AWS Educate ECP\. After you set your AWS Educate ECP password, store that password in a secure location\. The approval email contains information about AWS promotional credit that you can apply to your AWS account\. AWS promotional credit can help offset the cost of your individual use of qualifying AWS services, some of which can be used by or with AWS Cloud9\. To apply AWS promotional credit to your AWS account, do the following:

   1. With your AWS Educate ECP already open, choose **AWS Account**\.
**Note**  
To return to your AWS Educate ECP, go to the AWS Educate Site Login website, at [https://www\.awseducate\.com/signin/](https://www.awseducate.com/signin/)\. Enter the email address and password that you used when you initially signed in to your AWS Educate ECP, and then choose **Sign In**\.

   1. In the AWS navigation bar, choose **My Account, Billing & Cost Management**\.

   1. Enter the email address for your AWS account, and then choose **Next**\.
**Note**  
If an email address is already displayed and it's the wrong one, choose **Sign in to a different account**\. Enter the correct email address, and then choose **Next**\.

   1. Enter the password for your AWS account, and then choose **Sign in**\.
**Important**  
Enter the password for your AWS account, not your password for your AWS Educate ECP\.

   1. Choose **Credits**\.

   1. For **Promo Code**, enter the **Credit Code** from the approval email\.

   1. Complete the **Security Check**, and then choose **Redeem**\.

   1. To see the list of AWS services that qualify for this credit, choose **See complete list**\.
**Note**  
AWS Cloud9 isn't in this list of qualifying AWS services, because there is no additional charge for AWS Cloud9\. Instead, AWS automatically applies this credit toward qualifying AWS service usage, some of which can be used by or with AWS Cloud9\. For more information, see [AWS Cloud9 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/pricing/)\.

## Step 2: Set up your virtual classroom for AWS Cloud9<a name="setup-classroom-virtual"></a>

1. Follow the on\-screen instructions to download the email address upload template, fill in the template, and then upload your completed template\.

1. After you upload your completed template, choose **Submit**\.

   After AWS Educate approves your application, AWS will send you an email with the title **Your AWS Educate Classroom has been created**\. Note that the approval process might take a few days\. Do not go past this step in this procedure until you get this approval\. After you get the approval email, AWS Educate will start sending email invitations to each of the email addresses that you provided earlier in step 8 of this procedure\.
