# Working with Amazon CodeCatalyst<a name="ide-toolkits-cloud9"></a>



Amazon CodeCatalyst is a cloud\-based collaboration space for software development teams\. CodeCatalyst provides one place where you can work, collaborate on code, and build, test, and deploy applications with continuous integration/delivery \(CI/CD\) tools\. You can easily integrate with, and leverage, AWS resources with your projects by connecting your AWS accounts to your CodeCatalyst space\. CodeCatalyst enables you to deliver software quickly and confidently\. For more information about CodeCatalyst, see [What is Amazon CodeCatalyst?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/devenvironment.html) in the *Amazon CodeCatalyst Guide*\.

Dev Environments are cloud\-based development environments that you can use in CodeCatalyst to work on the code stored in the source repositories of your project\. You can create Dev Environments in CodeCatalyst to work on code in a project\-specific CodeCatalyst with a supported integrated development environment \(IDE\), or you can create an empty Dev Environment into which you can clone code from a third\-party repository and work on that code with a supported IDE, such as AWS Cloud9 IDE\.

The AWS Cloud9 IDE that you use to access your Dev Environment in the CodeCatalyst console, is not the same as the AWS Cloud9 IDE that runs on AWS\. In the CodeCatalyst AWS Cloud9 IDE you should be automatically logged into CodeCatalyst and will be able to access the service using the **aws\-explorer** option within the IDE\. For more information about the AWS Toolkit, see [AWS Toolkit for AWS Cloud9](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/toolkit-welcome.html) in the *AWS Cloud9 Guide*\.
