# Working with Amazon Lightsail instances in the AWS Cloud9 Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\)<a name="lightsail-instances"></a>

You can use the AWS Cloud9 IDE to work with code on Amazon Lightsail instances preconfigured with popular applications and frameworks such as WordPress, LAMP \(Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP\), Node\.js, Nginx, Drupal, and Joomla, as well as Linux distributions such as Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, and openSUSE\.

Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers, small businesses, students, and other users who need a simple virtual private server \(VPS\) solution\. Lightsail provides developers compute, storage, and networking capacity and capabilities to deploy and manage websites and web applications in the cloud\. Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly—a virtual machine, SSD\-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP—for a low, predictable monthly price\. For more information, see [Amazon Lightsail Features](https://amazonlightsail.com/features/)\.

In this topic, you create and set up a Linux\-based Lightsail instance that is compatible with AWS Cloud9\. You then create and connect an AWS Cloud9 SSH development environment to the Lightsail instance\.

**Note**  
Completing these procedures might result in charges to your AWS account\. These include possible charges for services such as Lightsail\. For more information, see [Amazon Lightsail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/)\.  
To create and set up a more advanced solution that includes a toolchain with the AWS Cloud9 IDE, source control, build, deployment, virtual servers or serverless resources, and more, skip the rest of this topic, and see [Working with AWS CodeStar Projects](codestar-projects.md) instead\.  
To use the AWS Cloud9 IDE to work with an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux or Ubuntu Server that contains no sample code, skip the rest of this topic, and see [Getting started: basic tutorials](tutorials-basic.md) instead\.

+  [Step 4: Use the AWS Cloud9 IDE to Change the Code on the Instance](#lightsail-instances-change-code) 

## Step 1: Create a Linux\-based Lightsail instance<a name="lightsail-instances-create"></a>

In this step, you use the Lightsail console to create an Amazon EC2 instance running an app in a Linux\-based distribution\. This instance automatically includes:
+ A public and private IP address\. \(You can create a static public IP later\.\)
+ Access to the instance using SSH over port 22, HTTP over port 80, and HTTPS over port 443\. \(You can change this\.\)
+ A block storage disk\. \(You can attach additional disks later\.\)
+ Built\-in system reporting\.

The Lightsail console enables you to back up, reboot, stop, or delete the instance later\.

1. Open and then sign in to the Lightsail console, at [https://lightsail\.aws\.amazon\.com](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com)\.

   We recommend you sign in using credentials for an IAM administrator user in your AWS account\. If you cannot sign in as an IAM administrator user, check with your AWS account administrator\.

1. If prompted, choose the language to use in the console, and then choose **Save**\.

1. If prompted, choose **Let's get started**\.

1. On the home page, with the **Instances** tab already selected, choose **Create instance**\.  
![\[Choosing the Create instance button in the Lightsail console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-lightsail-create-instance.png)

1. For **Instance location**, be sure the location matches an AWS Region where you want to create the instance and where AWS Cloud9 is available\. For more information, see [AWS Cloud9](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloud9_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. To change the AWS Region, Availability Zone, or both, choose **Change AWS Region and Availability Zone**, and then follow the onscreen instructions\.

1. For **Pick your instance image**, with **Linux/Unix** already chosen for **Select a platform**, and **Apps \+ OS** already chosen for **Select a blueprint**, choose a blueprint\.  
![\[Choosing an instance platform and blueprint in the Lightsail console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-lightsail-pick-instance-image.png)
**Note**  
If you want to create an instance with no app, choose **OS Only** instead of **Apps \+ OS**, and then choose a distribution\.  
To learn about the available choices, see [Choosing an Amazon Lightsail instance image](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/getting-started/article/compare-options-choose-lightsail-instance-image) on the Lightsail website\.

1. For **Choose your instance plan**, choose a plan, or leave the selected default plan\.

1. For **Name your instance**, type a name for the instance, or leave the suggested default name\.

1. For the number of instances, type the number of instances you want to create, or leave the default of a single instance \(**x 1**\)\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

## Step 2: Set up the instance to use it with AWS Cloud9<a name="lightsail-instances-setup"></a>

In this step, you connect to the running instance and then set it up so that AWS Cloud9 can use it later\.

**Note**  
The following instructions assume you chose **Apps \+ OS** in the previous step\. If you chose **OS Only** and a distribution other than **Ubuntu** instead, you might need to adapt the following instructions accordingly\.

1. With the Lightsail console still open from the previous step, on the **Instances** tab, in the card for the instance, choose the instance's name\.  
![\[Choosing to show instance details in the Lightsail console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-lightsail-show-instance-details.png)

1. On the **Connect** tab, for **Connect using your own SSH client**, note the **Public IP** and **User name** values, as you will need them later\.  
![\[Instance public address and user name showing in the Lightsail console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-lightsail-instance-ip-user.png)

1. Choose **Connect using SSH**\.

1. Be sure that the instance has the latest system updates\. To do this, in the terminal session that appears, run the command ** `sudo apt update` **\.

1. Check to see if Python is installed, and if it is, check to be sure the version is 2\.7\. To check the version, run the command ** `python --version` **, and note the version number that appears\. If no version number appears, or if the version is not 2\.7, install Python 2\.7 on the instance by running the command ** `sudo apt install -y python-minimal` **\.

1. Check to see if Node\.js is installed, and if it is, check that the version is 0\.6\.16 or later\. To check the version, run the command ** `node --version` **, and note the version number that appears\. If no version number appears, or the version is not 0\.6\.16 or later, we recommend you use Node Version Manager \(nvm\) to install Node\.js on the instance\.

   To do this, run the following commands one at a time, in the following order, to update the instance, install Node Version Manager \(nvm\) on the instance, activate nvm on the instance, and then install the latest version of Node\.js on the instance\.

   ```
   sudo apt update
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
   . ~/.bashrc
   nvm install node
   ```

1. Run the command ** `which node` **, and note the value that appears\. You will need it later\.
**Note**  
If the output of the command ** `which node` ** is something like `/usr/sbin/node`, AWS Cloud9 won't be able to find Node\.js in that path\. Instead, use nvm to install Node\.js, as described in the previous step in this procedure\. Then run the command `which node` again and note the new value that appears\.

1.  [Download and run the AWS Cloud9 Installer](installer.md#installer-download-run) on the instance\.

## Step 3: Create and connect to an AWS Cloud9 SSH Development Environment<a name="lightsail-instances-environment"></a>

In this step, you use the AWS Cloud9 console and the instance's terminal to create an SSH environment and then connect the environment to the running instance\.

1. With the terminal session still open from the previous step, sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console, as follows:
   + If you're the only individual using your AWS account or you are an IAM user in a single AWS account, go to [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloud9/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)\.
   + If your organization uses AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\), see your AWS account administrator for sign\-in instructions\.
**Note**  
For this step, you will work with two different AWS services at the same time\. If you signed in to the Lightsail console as an IAM administrator user, but you want a different entity to own the new SSH environment, we suggest opening a different web browser and signing in to the AWS Cloud9 console as that entity\.

1. In the AWS Cloud9 console, choose the AWS Region that matches the one you created the instance in\.  
![\[AWS Region selector in the AWS Cloud9 console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-region.png)

1. If a welcome page is displayed, for **New AWS Cloud9 environment**, choose **Create environment**\. Otherwise, choose **Create environment**\.  
![\[Choosing the Next step button if welcome page is displayed\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-welcome-new-env.png)

   Or:  
![\[Choosing the Create environment button if welcome page is not displayed\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-new-env.png)

1. On the **Name environment** page, for **Name**, type a name for your environment\.

1. To add a description to your environment, type it in **Description**\.

1. Choose **Next step**\.

1. On the **Configure settings** page, for **Environment type**, choose **Connect and run in remote server \(SSH\)**\.

1. For **User**, type the **User name** value you noted earlier\.

1. For **Host**, type the **Public IP** value you noted earlier\.

1. For **Port**, leave the default value of **22**\.

1. Expand **Advanced settings**\.

1. For **Environment path**, type the path that AWS Cloud9 will start from after login, which is `~/` \(the root of the user's home directory\)\.

1. For **Node\.js binary path**, type the value of the command ** `which node` ** you noted earlier\.

1. Leave **SSH jump host** blank\.

1. Store the public SSH key that AWS Cloud9 creates for this environment in your system clipboard\. To do this, choose **Copy key to clipboard**\.
**Note**  
To see the public SSH key value that was copied, expand **View public SSH key**\.

1. Save the public SSH key value you just copied to the instance\. To do this, use vi, a popular text editor, which is already installed on the instance:

   1. In the terminal session for the instance, run the command ** `vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` **\.

   1. In the vi editor that appears, go to the end of the file, and switch to insert mode\. To do this, press `G`, then `A`\. \(**\-\- INSERT \-\-** appears at the bottom of the vi editor\.\)

   1. Add two carriage returns to the end of the file by pressing `Enter` twice\.

   1. Paste the contents of your system clipboard, which contains the public SSH key value you just copied, to the terminal session clipboard\. To do this, in the bottom corner of the terminal session window, choose the clipboard button, then paste the contents of your system clipboard into the box\.  
![\[Opening the Lightsail terminal session clipboard\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-lightsail-terminal-clipboard.png)

   1. Paste the contents of the terminal session clipboard into the vi editor\. To do this, at the insertion point in the vi editor, press `Ctrl + Shift + V`\.

   1. Save the file\. To do this, press `Esc` to enter command mode\. \(**\-\- INSERT \-\-** disappears from the bottom of the vi editor\.\) Type `:wq` \(to `write` the file and then `quit` the vi editor\), and then press `Enter`\.

1. Back in the AWS Cloud9 console, choose **Next step**\.

1. On the **Review choices** page, choose **Create environment**\. Wait while AWS Cloud9 creates your environment and then displays the AWS Cloud9 IDE for the environment\. This can take several minutes\.

After AWS Cloud9 creates your environment, it displays the AWS Cloud9 IDE for the environment\.

If AWS Cloud9 doesn't display the IDE after at least five minutes, there might be a problem with your web browser, your AWS access permissions, the instance, or the associated virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. For possible fixes, see [Cannot Open an Environment](troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-env-loading) in *Troubleshooting*\.

## Step 4: Use the AWS Cloud9 IDE to change the code on the instance<a name="lightsail-instances-change-code"></a>

Now that the IDE appears for the new environment, you can use the terminal session in the IDE instead of the Lightsail terminal session\. The IDE provides a rich code editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, as well as color themes, shortcut keybindings, programming language\-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more\.

To learn how to use the IDE, see [Tour the AWS Cloud9 IDE](tour-ide.md)\.
