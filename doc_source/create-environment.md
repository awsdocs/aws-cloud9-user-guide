# Creating an environment in AWS Cloud9<a name="create-environment"></a>

To create an AWS Cloud9 development environment, follow one of these sets of procedures, depending on how you plan to use AWS Cloud9\.

|  If you're not sure what to choose, we recommend [Creating an EC2 Environment](create-environment-main.md)\. Creating an EC2 environment is the easiest option\. AWS Cloud9 automatically creates and sets up a new Amazon EC2 instance in your AWS account\. AWS Cloud9 then automatically connects that new instance to the environment for you\. To understand the key similarities and differences between the development environments, see [EC2 Environments versus SSH Environments in AWS Cloud9](ec2-env-versus-ssh-env.md)\.  |
