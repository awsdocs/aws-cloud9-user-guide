# Navigating and configuring the AWS Toolkit<a name="toolkit-navigation"></a>

You can access resources and modify settings through the following AWS Toolkit interface elements:
+ [**AWS Explorer** window](#working-with-aws-explorer): Access AWS services from different AWS Regions\.
+ [**AWS Toolkit** menu](#toolkit-menu): Create and deploy serverless applications, show/hide AWS Regions, access user assistance, and interact with Git repositories\. 
+ [**AWS Configuration** pane](#configuration-options): Modify settings that affect how you can interact with AWS services in AWS Toolkit\.

## Using AWS Explorer to work with services and resources in multiple AWS Regions<a name="working-with-aws-explorer"></a>

The **AWS Explorer** window allows you to select AWS services and work with specific resources associated with that service\. In **AWS Explorer**, you choose a service name node \(API Gateway or Lambda, for example\) and then choose a specific resource associated with that service \(a REST API or a Lambda function, for example\)\. When you choose a specific resource, a menu displays available interaction options such as upload/download, invoke, or copy\.

For example, if your AWS account credentials allow you to access Lambda functions, you can expand the Lambda node listed for an AWS Region and then select a specific Lambda function that can be invoked or uploaded as code to the AWS Cloud9 IDE\. You can also right\-click the node's title to start creating an application that uses the AWS Serverless Application Model\. 

**Note**  
If you can't see the option to view the **AWS Explorer** window in the IDE, make sure that you've enabled the AWS Toolkit\. For more information, see [Enabling AWS Toolkit](toolkit-welcome.md#access-toolkit)\.

The **AWS Explorer** window can also display services hosted in multiple AWS Regions\.

## To access AWS services from a selected AWS Region

1. In the **AWS Explorer** window, choose the **Toolkit** menu, **Show region in the Explorer**\.

1. From the **Select a region to show in the AWS Explorer** list, choose an AWS Region\.

   The selected AWS Region is added to the **AWS Explorer** window\. To access available services and resources, choose the arrow \(>\) in front of the AWS Region's name\. 

**Note**  
You can also hide selected AWS Regions in the **AWS Explorer window** using the following options:  
Right\-click the AWS Region and choose **Hide region from the Explorer**\.
In the AWS Toolkit menu , choose **Hide region from the Explorer** and select a Region to hide\.

## Accessing and using the AWS Toolkit menu<a name="toolkit-menu"></a>

The **AWS Toolkit** provides access for options to create and deploy [serverless applications](serverless-apps-toolkit.md)\. The menu also allows you to manage connections, update the **AWS: Explorer** window, access documentation, and interact with GitHub repositories\.

To access the **Toolkit** menu, choose the scroll icon opposite the **AWS: Explorer** title in the **AWS Explorer** window\.
