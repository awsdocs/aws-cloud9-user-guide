# Working with CloudWatch Logs using the AWS Toolkit<a name="cloudwatch-logs-toolkit"></a>

Amazon CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service\. You can then easily view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive them securely for future analysis\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
