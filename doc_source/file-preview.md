## Open a file for preview<a name="file-preview-file-open"></a>

Do one of the following in the AWS Cloud9 IDE to open a file preview tab within the environment:
+ In the **Environment** window, right\-click the file you want to preview, and then choose **Preview**\.
**Note**  
Although you can use this approach to preview any file, preview works best with files that have the following file extensions:  
 `.htm` 
 `.html` 
 `.pdf` 
 `.svg` 
 `.xhtml` 
Any file containing content in Markdown format\.
+ Open a file with one of the following file extensions:
  +  `.pdf` 
  +  `.svg` 
+ With the file you want to preview already open and active, on the menu bar, choose **Preview, Preview File FILE\_NAME**\. Or choose **Tools, Preview, Preview File FILE\_NAME**, where **FILE\_NAME** is the name of the file you want to preview\.
**Note**  
These commands work only with the following file types:  
 `.htm` 
 `.html` 
 `.markdown` 
 `.md` 
 `.pdf` 
 `.svg` 
 `.txt`: Preview works best if the file's content is in Markdown format\.
 `.xhtml`: Preview works best if the file contains or references content presentation information\.

**Note**  
The **Preview Settings** menu in the file preview tab is currently not functional and choosing any of its menu commands will have no effect\.

On the file preview tab, choose the **Refresh** button \(the circular arrow\)\.

## Change the file preview type<a name="file-preview-file-preview-type"></a>

  +  `.htm` 
  +  `.html` 
  +  `.pdf` 
  +  `.svg` 
  +  `.xhtml`: Preview works best if the file contains or references content presentation information\.
+  **Raw Content \(UTF\-8\)**: Previews the file's original contents in Unicode Transformation Format 8\-bit \(UTF\-8\) format\. This might display unexpected content for some file types\.
+  **Markdown**: Previews any file containing Markdown format\. Attempts to preview any other file type, but might display unexpected content\.

## Open a file preview in a separate web browser tab<a name="file-preview-file-open-tab"></a>

On the file preview tab, choose **Pop Out Into New Window**\.
