# VPC settings for AWS Cloud9 Development Environments<a name="vpc-settings"></a>

Every AWS Cloud9 development environment associated with an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) must meet specific VPC requirements\. These environments include EC2 environments, as well as SSH environments associated with AWS Cloud compute instances \(for example, Amazon EC2 and Amazon Lightsail instances\) that run within a VPC\.

## Amazon VPC requirements for AWS Cloud9<a name="vpc-settings-requirements"></a>

The Amazon VPC that AWS Cloud9 uses requires the following settings\. If you're already familiar with these requirements and just want to create a compatible VPC, skip ahead to [Create an Amazon VPC for AWS Cloud9](#vpc-settings-create-vpc)\.

Use the following checklist to confirm that the VPC meets **all** of the following requirements\.


****  

|  **Criteria**  |  **How to confirm**  |  **Additional resources**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  The VPC can be in the same AWS account and AWS Region as the AWS Cloud9 development environment\. —OR— The VPC can be a shared VPC in a different AWS account than the environment\. \(However, the VPC must be in the same AWS Region as the environment\)\.  |   [View a list of VPCs for an AWS Region](#vpc-settings-requirements-list-vpcs)   |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  | 
|  The VPC must have a public subnet\. \(A subnet is public if its traffic is routed to an internet gateway\.\) If your environment is accessing its EC2 instance directly though SSH, the instance can be launched into a public subnet only\.  If you're accessing a [no\-ingress Amazon EC2 instance](ec2-ssm.md) using Systems Manager, the instance can be launched into either a public or a private subnet\.  If you're using a public subnet, attach an internet gateway to the VPC so the SSM Agent for the instance can connect to Systems Manager\.  If you're using a private subnet, allow the instance for the subnet to communicate with the internet by hosting a NAT gateway in a public subnet\.  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  | 
|  The public subnet must have a route table with a minimum set of routes\.  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  | 
|  The associated security groups for the VPC \(or for the AWS Cloud compute instance, depending on your architecture\) must allow a minimum set of inbound and outbound traffic\.  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  | 
|  For an additional layer of security, if the VPC has a network ACL, the network ACL must allow a minimum set of inbound and outbound traffic\.  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/vpc-settings.html)  |   [Create a network ACL](#vpc-settings-requirements-network-acl-create)   | 

**Note**  
For the following procedures, if you use the Amazon VPC or Amazon EC2 consoles, we recommend that you sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc)\) or Amazon EC2 console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2)\) using credentials for an IAM administrator in your AWS account\.  
If you use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell, we recommend you configure the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell with the credentials for an IAM administrator in your AWS account\. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.

### View a list of VPCs for an AWS Region<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-list-vpcs"></a>

To use the Amazon VPC console, in the AWS navigation bar, choose the AWS Region that AWS Cloud9 creates the environment in\. Then, choose **Your VPCs** in the navigation pane\.

To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell, run the Amazon EC2** `describe-vpcs` ** command, for example, as follows\.

```
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --output table --query 'Vpcs[*].VpcId' --region us-east-2
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that AWS Cloud9 creates the environment in\. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotation marks with double quotation marks\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

The output contains the list of VPC IDs\.

### View a list of subnets for a VPC<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-subnets-view"></a>

To use the Amazon VPC console, choose **Your VPCs** in the navigation pane\. Note the ID of the VPC in the **VPC ID** column\. Then choose **Subnets** in the navigation pane, and look for subnets that contain that ID in the **VPC** column\.

To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell, run the Amazon EC2** `describe-subnets` ** command, for example, as follows\.

```
aws ec2 describe-subnets --output table --query 'Subnets[*].[SubnetId,VpcId]' --region us-east-2
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the subnets\. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotation marks with double quotation marks\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

In the output, look for subnets that match the VPC ID\.

### Confirm whether a subnet is public<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-subnet-public"></a>

**Note**  
Even if you're launching the instance for your environment into a private subnet, your VPC still requires a configured public subnet where you can create the network address translation \(NAT\) gateway\. The NAT gateway allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet\.

To use the Amazon VPC console, choose **Subnets** in the navigation pane\. Select the box next to the subnet you want AWS Cloud9 to use\. On the **Route Table** tab, if there's an entry in the **Target** column that starts with **igw\-**, the subnet is public\.

To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell, run the Amazon EC2** `describe-route-tables` ** command\.

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --output table --query 'RouteTables[*].Routes[*].{GatewayIds:GatewayId}' --region us-east-2 --filters Name=association.subnet-id,Values=subnet-12a3456b
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the subnet, and replace `subnet-12a3456b` with the subnet ID\. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotation marks with double quotation marks\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

In the output, if there's at least one result that starts with `igw-`, the subnet is public\.

In the output, if there are no results, the route table might be associated with the VPC instead of the subnet\. To confirm this, run the Amazon EC2** `describe-route-tables` ** command for the VPC related to the subnet instead of the subnet itself, for example, as follows\.

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --output table --query 'RouteTables[*].Routes[*].{GatewayIds:GatewayId}' --region us-east-1 --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-1234ab56
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the VPC, and replace `vpc-1234ab56` with the VPC ID\. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotation marks with double quotation marks\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

In the output, if there's at least one result that starts with `igw-`, the VPC contains an internet gateway\.

### View or change settings for an internet gateway<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-internet-gateway-view"></a>

To use the Amazon VPC console, choose **Internet Gateways** in the navigation pane\. Select the box next to the internet gateway\. To see the settings, look at each of the tabs\. To change a setting on a tab, choose **Edit** if applicable, and then follow the on\-screen directions\.

To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell to see the settings, run the Amazon EC2** `describe-internet-gateways` ** command\.

```
aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways --output table --region us-east-2 --internet-gateway-id igw-1234ab5c
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the internet gateway, and replace `igw-1234ab5c` with the internet gateway ID\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

### Create an internet gateway<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-internet-gateway-create"></a>

To use the Amazon VPC console, choose **Internet Gateways** in the navigation pane\. Choose **Create internet gateway**, and then follow the on\-screen directions\.

To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell, run the Amazon EC2** `create-internet-gateway` ** command\.

```
aws ec2 create-internet-gateway --output text --query 'InternetGateway.InternetGatewayId' --region us-east-2
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the new internet gateway\. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotation marks with double quotation marks\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

The output contains the ID of the new internet gateway\. 

### Attach an internet gateway to a VPC<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-internet-gateway-attach"></a>

To use the Amazon VPC console, choose **Internet Gateways** in the navigation pane\. Select the box next to the internet gateway\. Choose **Actions, Attach to VPC** if available, and then follow the on\-screen directions\.

To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell, run the Amazon EC2** `attach-internet-gateway` ** command, for example, as follows\.

```
aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --region us-east-2 --internet-gateway-id igw-a1b2cdef --vpc-id vpc-1234ab56
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the internet gateway, replace `igw-a1b2cdef` with the internet gateway ID, and replace `vpc-1234ab56` with the VPC ID\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

### Confirm whether a subnet has a route table<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-subnet-route-table"></a>

To use the Amazon VPC console, choose **Subnets** in the navigation pane\. Select the box next to the public subnet for the VPC that you want AWS Cloud9 to use\. On the **Route table** tab, if there's a value for **Route Table**, the public subnet has a route table\.

To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell, run the Amazon EC2** `describe-route-tables` ** command\.

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --output table --query 'RouteTables[*].Associations[*].{RouteTableIds:RouteTableId}' --region us-east-2 --filters Name=association.subnet-id,Values=subnet-12a3456b
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the public subnet, and replace `subnet-12a3456b` with the public subnet ID\. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotation marks with double quotation marks\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

If there are values in the output, the public subnet has at least one route table\.

In the output, if there are no results, the route table might be associated with the VPC instead of the subnet\. To confirm this, run the Amazon EC2** `describe-route-tables` ** command for the subnet's related VPC instead of the subnet itself, for example, as follows\.

```
aws ec2 describe-route-tables --output table --query 'RouteTables[*].Associations[*].{RouteTableIds:RouteTableId}' --region us-east-2 --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-1234ab56
```

In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the VPC, and replace `vpc-1234ab56` with the VPC ID\. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotation marks with double quotation marks\. To run the preceding command with the aws\-shell, omit `aws`\.

### Minimum inbound and outbound traffic settings for AWS Cloud9<a name="vpc-settings-requirements-traffic-settings"></a>

**Important**  
If a security group for an instance doesn't have an inbound rule, this means no incoming traffic originating from another host to the instance is allowed\. For information about using no\-ingress EC2 instances, see [Accessing no\-ingress EC2 instances with AWS Systems Manager](ec2-ssm.md)\.
+  **Inbound**: All IP addresses using SSH over port 22\. However, you can restrict these IP addresses to only those that AWS Cloud9 uses\. For more information, see [Inbound SSH IP address ranges for AWS Cloud9](ip-ranges.md)\.
**Note**  
For EC2 environments created on or after July 31 2018, AWS Cloud9 uses security groups to restrict inbound IP addresses using SSH over port 22 to only those addresses that AWS Cloud9 uses\. For more information, see [Inbound SSH IP address ranges for AWS Cloud9](ip-ranges.md)\.
+  **Inbound \(network ACLs only\)**: For EC2 environments, and for SSH environments associated with Amazon EC2 instances running Amazon Linux or Ubuntu Server, all IP addresses using TCP over ports 32768\-61000\. For more information, and for port ranges for other Amazon EC2 instance types, see [Ephemeral ports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.
+  **Outbound**: All traffic sources using any protocol and port\.

You can set this behavior at the security group level\. For an additional level of security, you can also use a network ACL\. For more information, see [Comparison of security groups and network ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html#VPC_Security_Comparison) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

For example, to add inbound and outbound rules to a security group, you could set up those rules as follows\.




**Inbound rules**  

|  **Type**  |  **Protocol**  |  **Port range**  |  **Source**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  SSH \(22\)  |  TCP \(6\)  |  22  |  0\.0\.0\.0 \(But see the following note and [Inbound SSH IP address ranges for AWS Cloud9](ip-ranges.md)\.\)  | 

**Note**  
For EC2 environments created on or after July 31 2018, AWS Cloud9 adds an inbound rule to restrict inbound IP addresses using SSH over port 22 to only those addresses that AWS Cloud9 uses\. For more information, see [Inbound SSH IP address ranges for AWS Cloud9](ip-ranges.md)\.




**Outbound rules**  

|  **Type**  |  **Protocol**  |  **Port range**  |  **Source**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  All traffic  |  ALL  |  ALL  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  | 

If you also choose to add inbound and outbound rules to a network ACL, you could set up those rules as follows\.




**Inbound rules**  

|  **Rule \#**  |  **Type**  |  **Protocol**  |  **Port range**  |  **Source**  |  **Allow / Deny**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  100  |  SSH \(22\)  |  TCP \(6\)  |  22  |  0\.0\.0\.0 \(But see [Inbound SSH IP address ranges for AWS Cloud9](ip-ranges.md)\.\)  |  ALLOW  | 
|  200  |  Custom TCP rule  |  TCP \(6\)  |  32768\-61000 \(For Amazon Linux and Ubuntu Server instances\. For other instance types, see [Ephemeral Ports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports)\.\)  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  ALLOW  | 
|   `*`   |  All traffic  |  ALL  |  ALL  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  DENY  | 




**Outbound rules**  

|  **Rule \#**  |  **Type**  |  **Protocol**  |  **Port range**  |  **Source**  |  **Allow / Deny**  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  100  |  All traffic  |  ALL  |  ALL  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  ALLOW  | 
|   `*`   | All traffic |  ALL  |  ALL  |  0\.0\.0\.0/0  |  DENY  |

## Create an Amazon VPC for AWS Cloud9<a name="vpc-settings-create-vpc"></a>

You can use the Amazon VPC console to create an Amazon VPC that is compatible with AWS Cloud9\.

**Note**  
For this procedure, we recommend that you sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console using credentials for an IAM administrator in your AWS account\. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.  
Some organizations may not allow you to create VPCs on your own\. If you can't create a VPC, check with your AWS account administrator or network administrator\.

1. If the Amazon VPC console isn't already open, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc)\.

1. In the navigation bar, if the AWS Region isn't the same as the environment, choose the correct AWS Region\.

1. Choose **VPC Dashboard** in the navigation pane, if the **VPC Dashboard** page isn't already displayed\.

1. Choose **Launch VPC Wizard**\.

1. For **Step 1: Select a VPC Configuration**, with **VPC with a Single Public Subnet** already selected, choose **Select**\.

1. For **Step 2: VPC with a Single Public Subnet**, we recommend that you don't change the following default settings\. \(However, you can change the CIDR settings if you have custom CIDRs you want to use\. For more information, see [VPC and subnet sizing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.\)
   +  **IPv4 CIDR block**: **10\.0\.0\.0/16** 
   +  **IPv6 CIDR block**: **No IPv6 CIDR Block** 
   +  **Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR**: **10\.0\.0\.0/24** 
   +  **Availability Zone**: **No Preference** 
   +  **Enable DNS hostnames**: **Yes** 
   +  **Hardware tenancy**: **Default** 

1. For **VPC name**, provide a name for the VPC\.

1. For **Subnet name**, provide a name for the subnet in the VPC\.

1. Choose **Create new VPC**\.

   Amazon VPC creates the following resources that are compatible with AWS Cloud9:
   + A VPC
   + A public subnet for the VPC
   + A route table for the public subnet with the minimum required settings
   + An internet gateway for the public subnet
   + A network ACL for the public subnet with the minimum required settings

1. By default, the VPC allows incoming traffic from all types, protocols, ports, and IP addresses\. You can restrict this behavior to allow only IP addresses coming from AWS Cloud9 using SSH over port 22\. One approach is to set incoming rules on the default network ACL for the VPC, as follows\.

   1. In the navigation pane of the Amazon VPC console, choose **Your VPCs**\.

   1. Select the box for the VPC that you just created\.

   1. On the **Description** tab, choose the link next to **Network ACL**\.

   1. Select the box next to the network ACL that's displayed\.

   1. On the **Inbound Rules** tab, choose **Edit inbound rules**\.

   1. For **Rule \# 100**, for **Type**, choose **SSH \(22\)**\.

   1. For **Source**, enter one of the CIDR blocks in the [Inbound SSH IP address ranges for AWS Cloud9](ip-ranges.md) list that matches the AWS Region for this VPC\.

   1. Choose **Add another rule**\.

   1. For **Rule \#**, enter `200`\.

   1. For **Type**, choose **SSH \(22\)**\.

   1. For **Source**, enter the other CIDR block in the [Inbound SSH IP address ranges for AWS Cloud9](ip-ranges.md) list that matches the AWS Region for this VPC\.

   1. At minimum, you must also allow incoming traffic from all IP addresses using TCP over ports 32768\-61000 for Amazon Linux and Ubuntu Server instance types\. \(For background, and for port ranges for other Amazon EC2 instance types, see [Ephemeral ports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\)\. To do this, choose **Add another rule**\.

   1. For **Rule \#**, enter `300`\.

   1. For **Type**, choose **Custom TCP Rule**\.

   1. For **Port Range**, enter `32768-61000` \(for Amazon Linux and Ubuntu Server instance types\)\.

   1. For **Source**, enter `0.0.0.0/0`\.

   1. Choose **Save**\.

   1. You might need to add more inbound or outbound rules to the network ACL, depending on how you plan to use AWS Cloud9\. See the documentation for the specific web services or APIs that you want to allow inbound and outbound communications for the VPC\. More specifically, check the **Type**, **Protocol**, **Port Range**, and **Source** settings for the network ACL rules to allow traffic to flow in an out of the subnets\.

## Create a subnet for AWS Cloud9<a name="vpc-settings-create-subnet"></a>

You can use the Amazon VPC console to create a subnet for a VPC that's compatible with AWS Cloud9\. Whether you can create a private or public subnet for your EC2 instance depends on how your environment connects to it: 
+ **Direct access through SSH:** public subnet only
+ **Access through Systems Manager**: public or private subnet

The option to launch your environment's EC2 into a private subnet is available only if you create a "no\-ingress" EC2 environment using [the console, command line, or AWS CloudFormation](ec2-ssm.md)\.

You follow the [same steps to create a subnet](#create-subnet-proc) that can be made public or private\. If the subnet is then associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, it becomes a public subnet\. But if the subnet is associated with a route table that does not have a route to an internet gateway, it becomes a private subnet\. For more information, see [Configuring a subnet as public or private](#public-private-subnet) 

If you followed the previous procedure to create a VPC for AWS Cloud9, you don't also need to follow this procedure\. This is because the **Create new VPC** wizard creates a subnet for you automatically\.

**Important**  
The AWS account must already have a compatible VPC in the same AWS Region for the environment\. For more information, see the VPC requirements in [Amazon VPC requirements for AWS Cloud9](#vpc-settings-requirements)\.
For this procedure, we recommend that you sign in to the AWS Management Console, and then open the Amazon VPC console using credentials for an IAM administrator in your AWS account\. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.
Some organizations might not allow you to create subnets on your own\. If you cannot create a subnet, check with your AWS account administrator or network administrator\.<a name="create-subnet-proc"></a>

**To create a subnet**

1. If the Amazon VPC console isn't already open, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc)\.

1. In the navigation bar, if the AWS Region isn't the same as the AWS Region for the environment, choose the correct AWS Region\.

1. Choose **Subnets** in the navigation pane, if the **Subnets** page isn't already displayed\.

1. Choose **Create Subnet**\.

1. In the **Create Subnet** dialog box, for **Name tag**, enter a name for the subnet\.

1. For **VPC**, choose the VPC to associate the subnet with\.

1. For **Availability Zone**, choose the Availability Zone within the AWS Region for the subnet to use, or choose **No Preference** to let AWS choose an Availability Zone for you\.

1. For **IPv4 CIDR block**, enter the range of IP addresses for the subnet to use, in CIDR format\. This range of IP addresses must be a subset of IP addresses in the VPC\.

   For information about CIDR blocks, see [VPC and subnet sizing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. See also [3\.1\. Basic Concept and Prefix Notation](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632#section-3.1) in RFC 4632 or [IPv4 CIDR blocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks) in Wikipedia\.

After you create the subnet, [configure it as either a public or private subnet](#public-private-subnet)\.

## Configuring a subnet as public or private<a name="public-private-subnet"></a>

After you create a subnet, you can make it public or private by specifying how it communicates with the internet\.

A public subnet has a public IP address and an internet gateway \(IGW\) is attached to it that allows communication between the instance for the subnet and the internet and other AWS services\.

An instance in a private subnet has a private IP address and a network address translation \(NAT\) gateway is used to send traffic back and forth between the instance for the subnet and the internet and other AWS services\. The NAT gateway must be hosted in a public subnet\.

------
#### [ Public subnets ]

**Note**  
Even if the instance for your environment is launched in a private subnet, your VPC must feature at least one public subnet\. This is because the NAT gateway that forwards traffic to and from the instance must be hosted in a public subnet\. 

Configuring a subnet as public involves attaching an internet gateway \(IGW\) to it, configuring a route table to specify a route to that IGW, and defining settings in a security group to control inbound and outbound traffic\.

 Guidance on carrying out these tasks is provided in [Create an Amazon VPC for AWS Cloud9](#vpc-settings-create-vpc)\. 

**Important**  
If your development environment is [using SSM to access an EC2 instance](ec2-ssm.md), ensure that the instance is assigned a public IP address by the public subnet it's launched into\. To do so, you can specify your own IP address or enable the automatic assignment of a public IP address\. For the steps involved in modifying auto\-assign IP settings, see [IP Addressing in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

------
#### [ Private subnets ]

If you're creating a no\-ingress instance that's accessed through Systems Manager, you can launch it into a private subnet\. Because a private subnet doesn't have a public IP address, a NAT gateway is required to map the private IP address to a public address for requests, and then map the public IP address back to the private address for the response\.

**Warning**  
You're charged for creating and using a NAT gateway in your account\. NAT gateway hourly usage and data processing rates apply\. Amazon EC2 charges for data transfer also apply\. For more information, see [Amazon VPC Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/                   )\. 

Before creating and configuring the NAT gateway, you must do the following:
+ Create a public VPC subnet to host the NAT gateway\.
+ Provision an [Elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html#WorkWithEIPs) that can be assigned to the NAT gateway\. 
+ For the private subnet, clear the **Enable auto\-assign public IPv4 address** check box so that the instance launched into it is assigned a private IP address\. For more information, see [IP Addressing in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

For the steps in this task, see [Working with NAT gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html#nat-gateway-working-with) in the * Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

**Important**  
Currently, if your environment’s EC2 instance is launched into a private subnet, you can't use [AWS managed temporary credentials](how-cloud9-with-iam.md#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials) to allow the EC2 environment to access an AWS service on behalf of an AWS entity \(an IAM user, for example\)\.
