# Working with User Settings in the AWS Cloud9 IDE<a name="settings-user"></a>

 *User settings* are settings that apply across each AWS Cloud9 development environment associated with your AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user\. They include the following kinds of settings:
+ General user interface behaviors, such as enabling animations and marking changed tabs
+ File system navigation behaviors
+ File find and search behaviors
+ Color schemes for terminal sessions and output
+ Additional code editor behaviors, such as font sizes, code folding, full line selection, scrolling animations, and font sizes

As you change your user settings, AWS Cloud9 pushes those changes to the cloud and associates them with your IAM user\. AWS Cloud9 also continually scans the cloud for changes to user settings associated with your IAM user, and applies those settings to your current environment\. This behavior enables you to experience the same look and feel no matter what AWS Cloud9 environment you're working in\.

**Note**  
To store and retrieve your IDE settings, AWS Cloud9 uses the internal APIs `GetUserSettings` and `UpdateUserSettings`\.

You can share your user settings with other users, as follows:
+  [View or Change Your User Settings](#settings-user-view) 
+  [Share Your User Settings with Another User](#settings-user-share) 
+  [User Setting Changes You Can Make](#settings-user-change) 

## View or Change Your User Settings<a name="settings-user-view"></a>

1. On the menu bar, choose **AWS Cloud9**, **Preferences**\.

1. To view your user settings across each of your environments, on the **Preferences** tab, in the side navigation pane, choose **User Settings**\.

1. In the **User Settings** pane, change your user settings across each of your environments\.

1. To apply your changes to any other of your environments, simply open that environment\. If that environment is already open, refresh the web browser tab for that environment\.

For more information, see [User Setting Changes You Can Make](#settings-user-change)\.

## Share Your User Settings with Another User<a name="settings-user-share"></a>

1. In both the source and target environment, on the menu bar of the AWS Cloud9 IDE, choose **AWS Cloud9, Open Your User Settings**\.

1. In the source environment, copy the contents of the **user\.settings** tab that is displayed\.

1. In the target environment,overwrite the contents of the **user\.settings** tab with the copied contents from the source environment\.
