## Deleting an Environment with the console<a name="delete-environment-console"></a>

**Warning**  
When you delete an environment, AWS Cloud9 deletes the environment permanently\. This includes permanently deleting all related settings, user data, and uncommitted code\. Deleted environments can't be recovered\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Cloud9 console:
   + If you're the only one using your AWS account or you're an IAM user in a single AWS account, go to [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloud9/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)\.
   + If your organization uses AWS Single Sign\-On \(SSO\), ask your AWS account administrator for sign\-in instructions\.
   + If you're using an AWS Educate Starter Account, see [Step 2: Sign in to the AWS Cloud9 Console](setup-student.md#setup-student-sign-in-ide) in *Individual Student Signup*\.
   + If you're a student in a classroom, ask your instructor for sign\-in instructions\.

1. In the top navigation bar, choose the AWS Region where the environment is located\.  
![\[AWS Region selector in the AWS Cloud9 console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-region.png)

1. In the list of environments, for the environment you want to delete, do one of the following actions\.
   + Choose the title of the card for the environment\. Then choose **Delete** on the next page\.  
![\[Deleting an environment from the environment details page\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-delete-env.png)
   + Select the card for the environment, and then choose the **Delete** button\.

1. In the **Delete** dialog box, type `Delete`, and then choose **Delete**\.
   + **EC2 environment**

     AWS Cloud9 also terminates the Amazon EC2 instance that was connected to that environment\.
**Note**  
If account deletion fails, a banner is displayed at the top of the console webpage\. Additionally, the card for the environment, if it exists, indicates that environment deletion failed\.
   + **SSH environment**

     If the environment was connected to an Amazon EC2 instance, AWS Cloud9 doesn't terminate that instance\. If you don't terminate that instance later, your AWS account might continue to have ongoing charges for Amazon EC2 related to that instance\.

1. If the environment was an SSH environment, AWS Cloud9 leaves behind a hidden subdirectory on the cloud compute instance or your own server that was connected to that environment\. You can now safely delete that subdirectory if you want to delete it\. The subdirectory is named `.c9`\. It's located in the **Environment path** directory that you specified when you created the environment\.

   If your environment isn't displayed in the console, try doing one or more of the following actions to have it be displayed\.
   + In the side navigation bar, choose one or more of the following\.
     + Choose **Your environments** to display all environments that your AWS entity owns within the selected AWS Region and AWS account\.
     + Choose **Shared with you** to display all environments your AWS entity has been invited to within the selected AWS Region and AWS account\.
     + Choose **Account environments** to display all environments within the selected AWS Region and AWS account that your AWS entity has permissions to display\.  
![\[Environment list scope in the AWS Cloud9 console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-env-list.png)
   + Choose the previous arrow, next arrow, or page number button to display more environments in the current scope\.  
![\[Environment list page control in the AWS Cloud9 console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/images/console-find-env.png)
   + If you think you should be a member of an environment, but the environment isn't displayed in the **Shared with you** list, check with the environment owner\.
   + In the top navigation bar, choose a different AWS Region\.
