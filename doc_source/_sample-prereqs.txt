This sample assumes you already have the |AC9IDE| for your |envfirst| open in your web browser, and that you're using an |envfirstec2| that is connected to an |EC2| instance running Amazon Linux. 
If you're using a different operating system or using an |envfirstssh|, you might need to adapt this sample's instructions to correctly 
install and configure this sample's required tools. To create 
an |env|, see :ref:`Creating an Environment <create-environment>`.

When you're using this sample, be sure you're signed in to AWS with the AWS account ID and name and password of the 
user you created or identified in :doc:`Team Setup <setup>`.
