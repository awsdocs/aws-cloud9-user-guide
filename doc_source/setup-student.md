# Using AWS Starter Account for AWS Cloud9<a name="setup-student"></a>

Students invited by their educator to join AWS Educate can receive an AWS Educate Starter Account, which offers students no\-cost access to a specified, capped amount of AWS cloud resources without requiring a credit card for payment\. The account provides access to most AWS Cloud services but does not allow for post\-graduation portability\.

Educators must first sign up as an [AWS Educate member](https://www.awseducate.com/registration)\. They then have the ability to invite their students through several tools that streamline the approval process within their educator portal\.

For more information see the [AWS Educate Frequently Asked Questions](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/aws-educate-faqs/)\.
