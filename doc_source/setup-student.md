+ You must be an eligible student\.
+ You don't need a credit card\.
+ There are some restrictions on AWS usage in the account\.
+ The account isn't eligible for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\.
+ After you graduate, you can no longer keep using the account\.
+ You can't link the account to any other account\.
+ You can't apply any additional AWS promotional credit to the account\.
+ AWS resources that you create in the account will stop working after all AWS promotional credit is used\.
+ If the account runs out of AWS promotional credit, the account is deactivated\.
+ You can't turn the account into a regular AWS account\.
