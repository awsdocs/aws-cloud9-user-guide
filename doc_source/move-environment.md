# Moving an environment and resizing or encrypting Amazon EBS volumes<a name="move-environment"></a>

You can move an AWS Cloud9 development environment from one Amazon EC2 instance to another\. For example, you might want to do the following actions:
+ Transfer an environment from an Amazon EC2 instance that is impaired or performing in unexpected ways compared with a healthy instance\.
+ Transfer an environment from an existing instance to one that has the latest system updates\.
+ Increase or decrease an instance's compute resources because the environment is overused or underused on the current instance\.

You can also resize the Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) volume that is associated with an Amazon EC2 instance for an environment\. For example, you might want to do one or both of the following actions:
+ Increase the size of a volume because you're running out of storage space on the instance\.
+ Decrease the size of a volume because you don't want to pay for extra storage space that you aren't using\.

Before you move or resize an environment, you can try stopping some running processes in the environment or adding a swap file to the environment\. For more information on dealing with low memory or high CPU usage, see the relevant issue in [*Troubleshooting*](troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-ide-low-memory)\.

**Note**  
This topic only describes moving an environment from one Amazon EC2 instance to another or resizing an Amazon EBS volume\. To resize an environment from one of your own servers to another or to change the storage space for one of your own servers, refer to your server's documentation\.

Finally, you can encrypt Amazon EBS resources to ensure the security of both data\-at\-rest and data\-in\-transit between an instance and its attached EBS storage\.

## Move an environment<a name="move-environment-move"></a>

Before you start the move process, note the following conditions:
+ You can't move an environment to an Amazon EC2 instance of the same type\. When you move, you must choose a different Amazon EC2 instance type for the new instance\.
+ You must stop the Amazon EC2 instance that is associated with an environment before you can change the instance type\. While the instance is stopped, you and any members can't use the environment that is associated with the stopped instance\.
+ AWS moves the instance to new hardware, however, the instance's ID doesn't change\.
+ If the instance is running in an Amazon VPC and has a public IPv4 address, AWS releases the address and give it a new public IPv4 address\. The instance retains its private IPv4 addresses, any Elastic IP addresses, and any IPv6 addresses\.
+ Plan for downtime while your instance is stopped\. The process might take several minutes\.

**To move an environment**

1. \(Optional\) If the new instance type requires drivers thataren't installed on the existing instance, you must connect to your instance and install those drivers first\. For more information, see [Compatibility for resizing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html#resize-limitations) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

1. Close all web browser tabs that are currently displaying the environment\.
**Important**  
If you don't close all of the web browser tabs that are currently displaying the environment, AWS Cloud9 might interfere with allowing you to complete this procedure\. Specifically, AWS Cloud9 might try at the wrong time during this procedure to restart the Amazon EC2 instance that's associated with the environment\. The instance must stay stopped until the very last step in this procedure\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, if you're not already signed in, at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com)\.

   We recommend you sign in using IAM administrator\-level credentials in your AWS account\. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console\. To do this, in the **Services** list, choose **EC2**\.

1. In the AWS navigation bar, choose the AWS Region that contains the environment that you want to move \(for example, **US East \(Ohio\)**\)\.

1. In the service navigation pane, expand **Instances**, and then choose **Instances**\.

1. In the list of instances, choose the one that's associated with the environment that you want to move\. For an EC2 environment, the instance name starts with `aws-cloud9-` followed by the environment name\. For example, if the environment is named `my-demo-environment`, the instance name will start with `aws-cloud9-my-demo-environment`\.

1. If the **Instance State** is not **stopped**, choose **Actions**, **Instance State**, **Stop**\. When prompted, choose **Yes, Stop**\. It can take a few minutes for the instance to stop\.

1. After the **Instance State** is **stopped**, with the instance still selected, choose **Actions**, **Instance Settings**, **Change Instance Type**\.

1. In the **Change Instance Type** dialog box, choose the new **Instance Type** for the environment to use\.
**Note**  
If the instance type you want doesn't appear in the list, it's not compatible with the configuration of the instance \(for example, because of its virtualization type\)\.

1. \(Optional\) If the instance type that you chose supports EBS–optimization, select **EBS\-optimized** to enable EBS–optimization, or clear **EBS\-optimized** to disable EBS–optimization\.
**Note**  
If the instance type you chose is EBS–optimized by default, **EBS\-optimized** is selected and you can't clear it\.

1. Choose **Apply** to accept the new settings\.
**Note**  
If you didn't choose a different instance type for **Instance Type** earlier in this procedure, nothing happens after you choose **Apply**\.

1. Reopen the environment\. For more information, see [Opening an environment in AWS Cloud9](open-environment.md)\.

For more information about the preceding procedure, see [Changing the instance type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## Resize an Amazon EBS volume used by an environment<a name="move-environment-resize"></a>

1. Open the environment that's associated with the Amazon EC2 instance for the Amazon EBS volume that you want to resize\.

1. In the AWS Cloud9 IDE for the environment, create a file with the following contents, and then save the file with the extension `.sh` \(for example, `resize.sh`\)\.
**Note**  
This script works for Amazon EBS volumes connected to EC2 instances running Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux, or Ubuntu Server\.  
 The script also resizes Amazon EBS volumes exposed as NVMe block devices on Nitro\-based instances\. For a list of instances based on the Nitro system, see [Nitro\-based instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Specify the desired volume size in GiB as a command line argument. If not specified, default to 20 GiB.
   SIZE=${1:-20}
   
   # Get the ID of the environment host Amazon EC2 instance.
   INSTANCEID=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
   
   # Get the ID of the Amazon EBS volume associated with the instance.
   VOLUMEID=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --instance-id $INSTANCEID \
     --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].BlockDeviceMappings[0].Ebs.VolumeId" \
     --output text)
   
   # Resize the EBS volume.
   aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id $VOLUMEID --size $SIZE
   
   # Wait for the resize to finish.
   while [ \
     "$(aws ec2 describe-volumes-modifications \
       --volume-id $VOLUMEID \
       --filters Name=modification-state,Values="optimizing","completed" \
       --query "length(VolumesModifications)"\
       --output text)" != "1" ]; do
   sleep 1
   done
   
   #Check if we're on an NVMe filesystem
   if [ $(readlink -f /dev/xvda) = "/dev/xvda" ]
   then
     # Rewrite the partition table so that the partition takes up all the space that it can.
     sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
   
     # Expand the size of the file system.
     # Check if we are on AL2
     STR=$(cat /etc/os-release)
     SUB="VERSION_ID=\"2\""
     if [[ "$STR" == *"$SUB"* ]]
     then
       sudo xfs_growfs -d /
     else
       sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
     fi
   
   else
     # Rewrite the partition table so that the partition takes up all the space that it can.
     sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1
   
     # Expand the size of the file system.
     # Check if we're on AL2
     STR=$(cat /etc/os-release)
     SUB="VERSION_ID=\"2\""
     if [[ "$STR" == *"$SUB"* ]]
     then
       sudo xfs_growfs -d /
     else
       sudo resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1p1
     fi
   fi
   ```

1. From a terminal session in the IDE, switch to the directory that contains the `resize.sh` file\. Then run either of the following commands, replacing `20` with the size in GiB you want to resize the Amazon EBS volume to:
   + 

     ```
     bash resize.sh 20
     ```
   + 

     ```
     chmod +x resize.sh
     ./resize.sh 20
     ```

## Encrypt Amazon EBS volumes used by AWS Cloud9<a name="encrypting-volumes"></a>

Amazon EBS encryption encrypts the following data:
+ Data at rest in the volume
+ All data moving between the volume and the instance
+ All snapshots created from the volume
+ All volumes created from those snapshots

You have two encryption options for Amazon EBS volumes that are used by AWS Cloud9 EC2 development environments:
+ **Encryption by default** – You can configure your AWS account to enforce the encryption of the new EBS volumes and snapshot copies that you create\. Encryption by default is enabled at the level of an AWS Region, so you can't enable it for individual volumes or snapshots in that Region\. In addition, because Amazon EBS encrypts the volume that's created when you launch an instance, you must enable this setting before the creation of an EC2 environment\. For more information, see [ Encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. 
+ **Encryption of an existing Amazon EBS volume used by an EC2 environment** – You can encrypt specific Amazon EBS volumes that are already created for EC2 instances\. This option involves using the AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) to manage access to the encrypted volumes\. For the relevant procedure, see [Encrypt an existing Amazon EBS volume used by AWS Cloud9](#encrypting-existing-volume)\.

### Encrypt an existing Amazon EBS volume used by AWS Cloud9<a name="encrypting-existing-volume"></a>

Encrypting an existing Amazon EBS volume involves using AWS KMS to create a customer master key \(CMK\)\. After you create a snapshot of the volume to replace, you use the CMK to encrypt a copy of the snapshot\.

 Next, you create an encrypted volume with that snapshot\. Then you replace the unencrypted volume by detaching it from the EC2 instance and attaching the encrypted volume\. 

Finally, you must update the key policy for the customer managed CMK to enable access for the AWS Cloud9 service role\. 

**Note**  
 The following procedure focuses on using a customer managed CMK to encrypt a volume\. You can also use an [AWS managed CMK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) for an AWS service in your account \(the alias for Amazon EBS is `aws/ebs`\)\. If you choose this default option for encryption, skip step 1 where you create a customer managed CMK\. Also skip step 8 where you update the key policy \(you can't change the key policy for an AWS managed CMK\)\.<a name="creating-encrypted-volume"></a>

**To encrypt an existing Amazon EBS volume**

1. In the AWS KMS console, create a symmetric CMK\. For more information, see [Creating symmetric CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, stop the Amazon EBS\-backed instance used by the environment\. You can [stop the instance using the console or the command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the Amazon EC2 console, choose **Snapshots** [to create a snapshot of the existing volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html#ebs-create-snapshot) you want to encrypt\.

1. In the navigation pane of the Amazon EC2 console, choose **Snapshots** [to copy the snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html)\. In the **Copy snapshot** dialog box, do the following to enable encryption:
   + Choose **Encrypt this snapshot**\. 
   + For **Master Key**, select the CMK you created earlier\. \(If you're using an AWS managed CMK, keep the **\(default\) aws/ebs** setting\.\)

1. [Create a new volume from the encrypted snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-volume.html#ebs-create-volume-from-snapshot)\. 
**Note**  
New Amazon EBS volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted\. 

1. [Detach the old Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html) from the Amazon EC2 instance\. 

1. [Attach the new encrypted volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html) to the Amazon EC2 instance\.

1. Update the key policy for the CMK [using the AWS Management Console default view, AWS Management Console policy view, or AWS KMS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying.html#key-policy-modifying-how-to)\. Add the following key policy statements to allow the AWS Cloud9 service, `AWSServiceRoleForAWSCloud9`, to access the CMK\.
**Note**  
If you're using an AWS managed CMK, skip this step\.

   ```
   {
       "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:{Partition}:iam::{AccountId}:role/aws-service-role/cloud9.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAWSCloud9"
