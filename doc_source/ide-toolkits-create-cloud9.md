# Creating a Dev Environment<a name="ide-toolkits-create-cloud9"></a>

You can create a Dev Environment in multiple ways:
+ Create a Dev Environment in CodeCatalyst with a CodeCatalyst source repository from the **Summary**, **Dev Environment** or **Source repositories** pages\.
+ Create an empty Dev Environment that is not connected to a source repository in CodeCatalyst from Dev Environments\.
+ Create a Dev Environment in your IDE of choice and clone a CodeCatalyst source repository into the Dev Environment\.

You can create one Dev Environment for each branch and repository\. A project can have multiple repositories\. Your Dev Environments are only associated with your CodeCatalyst account, and can only be managed by your CodeCatalyst account\. You can open the Dev Environment and work with it with any of the supported IDEs\. Once you have chosen a specific IDE, you can only open that Dev Environment with that IDE\. If you want to use a different IDE you will need to create a new Dev Environment\. By default, Dev Environments are created with a 2\-core processor, 4GB of RAM, and 16 GB of persistent storage\.  

For information and steps on creating a Dev Environment in CodeCatalyst, see [Creating a Dev Environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/devenvironment-create.html) in the *Amazon CodeCatalyst guide*\.
