# Calling AWS services from an environment in AWS Cloud9<a name="credentials"></a>

You can call AWS services from an AWS Cloud9 development environment\. For example, you can do the following actions:
+ Upload and download data in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) buckets\.
+ Send broadcast notifications through Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topics\.
+ Read and write data in Amazon DynamoDB \(DynamoDB\) databases\.

You can call AWS services from your environment in several ways\. For example, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) or the aws\-shell to run commands from a terminal session\. You can also call AWS services from code you run within your environment, using AWS SDKs for programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, and C\+\+\. For more information, see the [AWS CLI and aws\-shell Sample](sample-aws-cli.md), the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/), and the [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk)\.

Each time the AWS CLI, the aws\-shell, or your code calls an AWS service, the AWS CLI, the aws\-shell, or your code must provide a set of AWS access credentials along with the call\. These credentials determine whether the caller has the appropriate permissions to make the call\. If the credentials don't cover the appropriate permissions, the call fails\.

There are several ways to provide credentials to your environment\. The following table describes some approaches\.


****  

| Environment type | Approach | 
| --- | --- | 
|  EC2  |  Use AWS managed temporary credentials\. We recommend this approach for an EC2 environment\. AWS managed temporary credentials manage AWS access credentials in an EC2 environment on your behalf, while also following AWS security best practices\.  **If you're using an EC2 environment, you can skip the rest of this topic\. This is because AWS managed temporary credentials are already set up for you in the environment\.**  For more information, see [AWS Managed Temporary Credentials](how-cloud9-with-iam.md#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials)\.  | 
|  EC2  |  Attach an IAM instance profile to the instance\. You should only use this approach if for some reason you can't use AWS managed temporary credentials\. Similar to AWS managed temporary credentials, an instance profile manages AWS access credentials on your behalf\. However, you must create, manage, and attach the instance profile to the Amazon EC2 instance yourself\. For instructions, see [Create and Use an Instance Profile to Manage Temporary Credentials](#credentials-temporary)\.  | 
|  EC2 or SSH  |  Store your permanent AWS access credentials within the environment\. This approach is less secure than using temporary AWS access credentials\. However, it's the only supported approach for an SSH environment\. For instructions, see [Create and Store Permanent Access Credentials in an Environment](#credentials-permanent-create)\.  | 
|  EC2 or SSH  |  Insert your permanent AWS access credentials directly into your code\. We discourage this approach because it doesn't follow AWS security best practices\. Because we discourage this approach, we do not cover it in this topic\.  | 

## Create and use an instance profile to manage temporary credentials<a name="credentials-temporary"></a>

**Note**  
You can't use this procedure for an AWS Cloud9 SSH development environment\. Instead, skip ahead to [Create and Store Permanent Access Credentials in an Environment](#credentials-permanent-create)\.  
We recommend that you use AWS managed temporary credentials instead of an instance profile\. Follow these instructions only if for some reason you can't use AWS managed temporary credentials\. For more information, see [AWS Managed Temporary Credentials](how-cloud9-with-iam.md#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials)\.

This procedure uses IAM and Amazon EC2 to create and attach an IAM instance profile to the Amazon EC2 instance that connects to your environment\. This instance profile manages temporary credentials on your behalf\. This procedure assumes you have already created an environment in AWS Cloud9\. To create an environment, see [Create an Environment](create-environment.md)\.

You can complete these tasks with the [IAM and Amazon EC2 consoles](#credentials-temporary-create-console) or the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](#credentials-temporary-create-cli)\.

### Create an instance profile with the IAM console<a name="credentials-temporary-create-console"></a>

**Note**  
If you already have an IAM role that contains an instance profile, skip ahead to [Attach an Instance Profile to an Instance with the Amazon EC2 Console](#credentials-temporary-attach-console)\.

1. Sign in to the IAM console, at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)\.

   For this step, we recommend you sign in using IAM administrator\-level credentials in your AWS account\. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.

1. In the navigation bar, choose **Roles**\.
**Note**  
You cannot use the IAM console to create an instance profile by itself\. You must create an IAM role, which contains an instance profile\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

1. On the **Select type of trusted entity** page, with **AWS service** already chosen, for **Choose the service that will use this role**, choose **EC2**\.

1. For **Select your use case**, choose **EC2**\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Attach permissions policies** page, in the list of policies, select the box next to **AdministratorAccess**, and then choose **Next: Review**\.
**Note**  
The **AdministratorAccess** policy allows unrestricted access to all AWS actions and resources across your AWS account\. It should be used only for experimentation purposes\. For more information, see [IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. On the **Review** page, for **Role Name**, type a name for the role \(for example, `my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile`\)\.

1. Choose **Create Role**\.

Skip ahead to [Attach an Instance Profile to an Instance with the Amazon EC2 Console](#credentials-temporary-attach-console)\.

### Create an instance profile with the AWS CLI<a name="credentials-temporary-create-cli"></a>

**Note**  
If you already have an IAM role that contains an instance profile, skip ahead to [Attach an Instance Profile to an Instance with the AWS CLI](#credentials-temporary-attach-cli)\.  
For this topic, we recommend you configure the AWS CLI using IAM administrator\-level credentials in your AWS account\. If you cannot do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.

**Note**  
If you're using [AWS managed temporary credentials](how-cloud9-with-iam.md#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials), you can't use a terminal session in the AWS Cloud9 IDE to run some or all of the commands in this section\. To address AWS security best practices, AWS managed temporary credentials donâ€™t allow some commands to be run\. Instead, you can run those commands from a separate installation of the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\.

1. Define a trust relationship in AWS for the instance profile's required IAM role\. To do this, create and then save a file with the following contents \(for example, `my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile-role-trust.json`\)\.

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

1. Using the terminal or command prompt, switch to the directory where you just saved this file\.

1. Create an IAM role for the instance profile\. To do this, run the IAM `create-role` command, specifying a name for the new IAM role \(for example, `my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile-role`\), and the name of the file that you just saved\.

   ```
   aws iam create-role --role-name my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile-role --assume-role-policy-document file://my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile-role-trust.json
   ```

1. Attach AWS access permissions to the instance profile IAM role\. To do this, run the IAM `attach-role-policy` command, specifying the name of the existing IAM role and the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the AWS managed policy named `AdministratorAccess`\.

   ```
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
   ```
**Note**  
The **AdministratorAccess** policy allows unrestricted access to all AWS actions and resources across your AWS account\. It should be used only for experimentation purposes\. For more information, see [IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Create the instance profile\. To do this, run the IAM `create-instance-profile` command, specifying a name for the new instance profile \(for example, `my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile`\)\.

   ```
   aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile
   ```

1. Attach the IAM role to the instance profile\. To do this, run the IAM `add-role-to-instance-profile`, specifying the names of the existing IAM role and instance profile\.

   ```
   aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --role-name my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile-role --instance-profile-name my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile
   ```

Skip ahead to [Create an Instance Profile with the AWS CLI](#credentials-temporary-create-cli)\.

### Attach an instance profile to an instance with the Amazon EC2 console<a name="credentials-temporary-attach-console"></a>

1. Sign in to the Amazon EC2 console, at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2)\.

   For this step, we recommend that you sign in using IAM administrator\-level credentials in your AWS account\. If you cannot do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.

1. In the navigation bar, be sure the Region selector displays the AWS Region that matches the one for your environment\. For example, if you created your environment in the US East \(Ohio\) Region, choose **US East \(Ohio\)** in the Region selector here as well\.

1. Choose the **Running Instances** link or, in the navigation pane, expand **Instances**, and then choose **Instances**\.

1. In the list of instances, choose the instance with the **Name** that includes your environment name\. For example, if your environment name is `my-demo-environment`, choose the instance with the **Name** that includes **my\-demo\-environment**\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Instance Settings**, **Attach/Replace IAM Role**\.
**Note**  
Although you are attaching a role to the instance, the role contains an instance profile\.

1. On the **Attach/Replace IAM Role** page, for **IAM role**, choose the name of the role you identified or that you created in the previous procedure, and then choose **Apply**\.

1. Back in the environment, use the AWS CLI to run the `aws configure` command or the aws\-shell to run the `configure` command\. Do not specify any values for **AWS Access Key ID** or **AWS Secret Access Key** \(press `Enter` after each of these prompts\)\. For **Default region name**, specify the AWS Region closest to you or the Region where your AWS resources are located\. For example, `us-east-2` for the US East \(Ohio\) Region\. For a list of Regions, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. Optionally, specify a value for **Default output format** \(for example, `json`\)\.

You can now start calling AWS services from your environment\. To use the AWS CLI, the aws\-shell, or both to call AWS services, see the [AWS CLI and aws\-shell Sample](sample-aws-cli.md)\. To call AWS services from your code, see our other [tutorials and samples](tutorials.md)\.

### Attach an instance profile to an instance with the AWS CLI<a name="credentials-temporary-attach-cli"></a>

**Note**  
If you're using [AWS managed temporary credentials](how-cloud9-with-iam.md#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials), you can't use a terminal session in the AWS Cloud9 IDE to run some or all of the commands in this section\. To address AWS security best practices, AWS managed temporary credentials donâ€™t allow some commands to be run\. Instead, you can run those commands from a separate installation of the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\.

1. Run the Amazon EC2 `associate-iam-instance-profile` command, specifying the name of the instance profile and the ID and AWS Region ID of the Amazon EC2 instance for the environment\.

   ```
   aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --iam-instance-profile Name=my-demo-cloud9-instance-profile --region us-east-2 --instance-id i-12a3b45678cdef9a0
   ```

   In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region ID for the instance and `i-12a3b45678cdef9a0` with the instance ID\.

   To get the instance ID, you can, for example, run the Amazon EC2 `describe-instances` command, specifying the name and AWS Region ID of the environment\.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-2 --filters Name=tag:Name,Values=*my-environment* --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" --output text
   ```

   In the preceding command, replace `us-east-2` with the AWS Region ID for the instance and `my-environment` with the name of the environment\.

1. Back in the environment, use the AWS CLI to run the `aws configure` command or the aws\-shell to run the `configure` command\. Do not specify any values for **AWS Access Key ID** or **AWS Secret Access Key** \(press `Enter` after each of these prompts\)\. For **Default region name**, specify the AWS Region closest to you or the Region where your AWS resources are located\. For example, `us-east-2` for the US East \(Ohio\) Region\. For a list of Regions, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. Optionally, specify a value for **Default output format** \(for example, `json`\)\.

You can now start calling AWS services from your environment\. To use the AWS CLI, the aws\-shell, or both to call AWS services, see the [AWS CLI and aws\-shell Sample](sample-aws-cli.md)\. To call AWS services from your code, see our other [tutorials and samples](tutorials.md)\.

## Create and store permanent access credentials in an Environment<a name="credentials-permanent-create"></a>

**Note**  
If you're using an AWS Cloud9 EC2 development environment, we recommend that you use AWS managed temporary credentials instead of AWS permanent access credentials\. To work with AWS managed temporary credentials, see [AWS managed temporary credentials](how-cloud9-with-iam.md#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials)\.

In this section, you use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to generate a set of permanent credentials that the AWS CLI, the aws\-shell, or your code can use when calling AWS services\. This set includes an AWS access key ID and an AWS secret access key, which are unique to your user in your AWS account\. If you already have an AWS access key ID and an AWS secret access key, note those credentials, and then skip ahead to [Store Permanent Access Credentials in an Environment](#credentials-permanent-create-store)\.

You can create a set of permanent credentials with the [IAM console](#credentials-permanent-create-console) or the [AWS CLI](#credentials-permanent-create-cli)\.

### Create permanent access credentials with the console<a name="credentials-permanent-create-console"></a>

1. Sign in to the IAM console, at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)\.

   For this step, we recommend that you sign in using IAM administrator\-level credentials in your AWS account\. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.

1. In the navigation bar, choose **Users**\.

1. In the list of users, choose the name of the user you created or identified in [Team Setup](setup.md)\.

1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

1. For **Access keys**, choose **Create access key**\.

1. In the **Create access key** page, choose **Show**, and make a note of the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** values\. We recommend that you also choose **Download \.csv file** and save these credentials in a secure location\.

Skip ahead to [Store Permanent Access Credentials in an Environment](#credentials-permanent-create-store)\.

### Create permanent access credentials with the AWS CLI<a name="credentials-permanent-create-cli"></a>

**Note**  
For this section, we recommend that you configure the AWS CLI using IAM administrator\-level credentials in your AWS account\. If you cannot do this, check with your AWS account administrator\.

**Note**  
If you're using [AWS managed temporary credentials](how-cloud9-with-iam.md#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials), you can't use a terminal session in the AWS Cloud9 IDE to run some or all of the commands in this section\. To address AWS security best practices, AWS managed temporary credentials donâ€™t allow some commands to be run\. Instead, you can run those commands from a separate installation of the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\.

Run the IAM `create-access-key` command to create a new AWS access key and corresponding AWS secret access key for the user\.

```
aws iam create-access-key --user-name MyUser
```

In the preceding command, replace `MyUser` with the name of the user\.

In a secure location, save the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` values that are displayed\. After you run the IAM `create-access-key` command, this is the only time you can use the AWS CLI to view the user's AWS secret access key\. To generate a new AWS secret access key for the user later if needed, see [Creating, Modifying, and Viewing Access Keys \(API, CLI, PowerShell\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey_CLIAPI) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

### Store permanent access credentials in an Environment<a name="credentials-permanent-create-store"></a>

In this procedure, you use the AWS Cloud9 IDE to store your permanent AWS access credentials in your environment\. This procedure assumes you have already created an environment in AWS Cloud9, opened the environment, and are displaying the AWS Cloud9 IDE in your web browser\. For more information, see [Creating an Environment](create-environment.md) and [Opening an Environment](open-environment.md)\.

**Note**  
The following procedure shows how to store your permanent access credentials by using environment variables\. If you have the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell installed in your environment, you can use the ** `aws configure` ** command for the AWS CLI or the ** `configure` ** command for the aws\-shell to store your permanent access credentials instead\. For instructions, see [Quick Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-quick-configuration) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

1. With your environment open, in the AWS Cloud9 IDE, start a new terminal session, if one is not already started\. To start a new terminal session, on the menu bar, choose **Window**, **New Terminal**\.

1. Run each of the following commands, one command at a time, to set local environment variables representing your permanent access credentials\. In these commands, after `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:`, type your AWS access key ID\. After `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, type your AWS secret access key\. After `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION_ID`, type the AWS Region identifier associated with the AWS Region closest to you \(or your preferred AWS Region\)\. For a list of available identifiers, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. For example, for the US East \(Ohio\) Region, you would use `us-east-2`\.

   ```
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=
   ```

1. Note that the preceding environment variables are valid only for the current terminal session\. To make these environment variables available across terminal sessions, you must add them to your shell profile file as user environment variables, as follows\.

   1. In the **Environment** window of the IDE, choose the gear icon, and then choose **Show Home in Favorites**\. Repeat this step and choose **Show Hidden Files** as well\.

   1. Open the `~/.bashrc` file\.

   1. Type or paste the following code at the end of the file\. In these commands, after `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:`, type your AWS access key ID\. After `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, type your AWS secret access key\. After `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION_ID`, type the AWS Region identifier associated with the AWS Region closest to you \(or your preferred AWS Region\)\. For a list of available identifiers, see [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. For example, for the US East \(Ohio\) Region, you would use `us-east-2`\.

      ```
      export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
      export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
      export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=
      ```

   1. Save the file\.

   1. Source the `~/.bashrc` file to load these new environment variables\.

      ```
      . ~/.bashrc
      ```

You can now start calling AWS services from your environment\. To use the AWS CLI or the aws\-shell to call AWS services, see the [AWS CLI and aws\-shell Sample](sample-aws-cli.md)\. To call AWS services from your code, see our other [tutorials and samples](tutorials.md)\.
